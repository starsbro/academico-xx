# CI/CD Pipeline Status & Troubleshooting

## ✅ Pipeline Fix Applied

### Problems Solved

1. **Firebase Auth Error**: `Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)` during build process
2. **GitHub Permissions Error**: `Resource not accessible by integration` (403 error)

#### Firebase Auth Issue

The CI/CD pipeline was failing because:

- **Missing Environment Variables**: GitHub Actions didn't have access to Firebase config during build
- **Static Generation Issue**: Next.js was trying to initialize Firebase during static page generation
- **Build-time vs Runtime**: Firebase was being initialized at build time instead of runtime

#### GitHub Permissions Issue

The Firebase Deploy action was failing because:

- **Missing Permissions**: Workflows lacked proper GitHub permissions
- **Check Runs Access**: Action couldn't create status checks and PR comments
- **Integration Limits**: Default permissions were too restrictive

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Firebase Configuration**:

   - Added fallbacks for missing environment variables
   - Conditional initialization only when required config is available
   - Null checks for all auth functions
   - Build safety without Firebase credentials

2. **GitHub Permissions**:
   - Added comprehensive permissions to all workflow files
   - Granted `checks: write`, `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`
   - Added `actions: read` and `statuses: write` permissions
   - Fixed integration access for Firebase Deploy action

### Changes Made

- `/frontend/src/lib/firebase.ts`: Added conditional Firebase initialization
- `/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Added null checks for auth functions
- `/frontend/.env.example`: Updated to show required Firebase environment variables
- **All workflow files**: Added comprehensive GitHub Actions permissions
- **Permission sections**: Added to `ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`, `test.yml`, `release.yml`, etc.
- **Firebase Deploy**: Fixed integration permissions for preview deployments

## 🔍 Current Pipeline Status

Your CI/CD pipeline should now:

- ✅ **Build Successfully**: Both with and without environment variables
- ✅ **Run Tests**: ESLint, TypeScript, Jest (unit/integration), and Playwright (E2E) tests
- ✅ **Unified Test Structure**: All tests use configs from `/tests/config/`
- ✅ **Deploy Previews**: For Pull Requests (when secrets are configured)
- ✅ **Production Deploy**: When pushing to main/develop (when secrets are configured)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Monitor Your Current Build

Check the Actions tab in your repository to see if the pipeline is now passing:

- Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/academico-xx/actions`
- Look for the latest workflow run triggered by your recent push

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets (If Not Done Yet)

If you haven't added the GitHub secrets yet, you'll need them for deployment:

```bash
# Required secrets (7 total):
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ACADEMICO_AI
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
```

See `/docs/setup/github-secrets-setup.md` for detailed instructions.

### 3. Test Different Scenarios

- **Build Only**: Push to `dev` branch (tests without deploying)
- **Preview**: Create Pull Request (tests + preview deployment)
- **Production**: Push to `main` or `develop` (full deployment)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails

1. **Check Error Logs**: Go to Actions tab and click on the failed workflow
2. **Common Issues**:
   - Missing GitHub secrets (deployment will fail)
   - TypeScript errors (build will fail)
   - Test failures (pipeline will fail)

### If Deployment Fails

1. **Verify Secrets**: Ensure all 7 GitHub secrets are correctly added
2. **Check Permissions**: Service account should have required Firebase permissions
3. **Firebase Project**: Ensure project ID matches in secrets

### Local Testing

Always test locally before pushing:

```bash
# Root level tests (unified structure)
npm run test:unit:frontend
npm run test:unit:backend
npm run test:e2e

# Individual test types
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# E2E test variations
npm run test:e2e:ui        # Interactive mode
npm run test:e2e:headed    # Browser visible

# Frontend specific
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run lint

# Backend specific
cd backend/functions
npm run build
npm run lint
```

### Test Configuration

- **Unit Tests**: `/tests/config/jest.config.frontend.js` & `/tests/config/jest.config.backend.js`
- **Integration Tests**: `/tests/config/jest.config.frontend.js` & `/tests/config/jest.config.backend.js`
- **E2E Tests**: `/tests/config/playwright.config.ts`
- **Test Results**: All saved to `/tests/test-results/`

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your pipeline is working when you see:

- ✅ Green checkmarks in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Successful builds in action logs
- ✅ Preview URLs in PR comments (when secrets are configured)
- ✅ Live site updates at https://your-project.web.app (when deployed)
