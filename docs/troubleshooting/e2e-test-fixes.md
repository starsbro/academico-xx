# E2E Test Configuration Fix

## 🐛 Issue
The E2E tests were failing in the GitHub Actions pipeline because the workflow was looking for test results and reports in the wrong directories after we consolidated the test structure.

## 🔧 Root Cause
- **Old structure**: Tests were in `/frontend/e2e/` with reports in `/frontend/playwright-report/`
- **New structure**: Tests moved to `/tests/e2e/` with reports in `/test-configs/test-results/`
- **GitHub Actions workflow**: Still pointing to old paths

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`)
- **Fixed installation process**: Now installs both root and frontend dependencies
- **Updated test command**: Uses centralized config `test-configs/playwright.config.ts`
- **Corrected artifact paths**: Points to `test-configs/test-results/` instead of `frontend/`
- **Fixed result parsing**: Looks for results in correct location

### 2. Updated Playwright Configuration (`test-configs/playwright.config.ts`)
- **Output directories**: All reports now go to `test-configs/test-results/`
- **Fixed syntax**: Removed duplicate closing brace that caused errors
- **Proper structure**: Maintained all browser configurations (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### GitHub Actions Workflow:
```yaml
# Before:
path: frontend/playwright-report/
path: frontend/test-results/

# After:  
path: test-configs/test-results/playwright-report/
path: test-configs/test-results/
```

#### Playwright Config:
```typescript
// Before:
outputFolder: 'test-results/playwright-report'

// After:
outputFolder: 'test-configs/test-results/playwright-report'
outputDir: 'test-configs/test-results'
```

## 🧪 What This Fixes
- ✅ **Artifact Upload Errors**: No more "No files were found" errors
- ✅ **Test Execution**: E2E tests now run from correct location (`/tests/e2e/`)
- ✅ **Result Reporting**: Test results properly uploaded and accessible
- ✅ **Multi-browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit all working
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: E2E tests no longer block the deployment process

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
- E2E tests should now pass in the GitHub Actions pipeline
- Test artifacts (reports, videos, screenshots) will be properly uploaded
- Preview deployment will proceed after successful tests
- All browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) will be tested

## 📋 Files Modified
1. `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` - Updated paths and installation process
2. `test-configs/playwright.config.ts` - Fixed output directories and syntax

The E2E tests are now properly aligned with the consolidated test structure! 🎉
