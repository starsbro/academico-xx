# Example Components

The components in this directory (like `Button`, `ThemeToggle`, and `FeatureCard`) are provided as basic examples to demonstrate:

- Component structure in a Next.js application.
- Usage of CSS Modules for styling (`*.module.css`).
- Basic TypeScript usage for props and component definition.
- Example unit tests (see `Button/__tests__`).
- Interactive component behavior (see `FeatureCard` for an expandable card).

Feel free to modify, extend, or remove these components as you develop your application. They are intended as a starting point and not as a prescribed UI library.
