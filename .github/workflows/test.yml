# DISABLED: Test & Quality Checks - Using local testing instead
# This workflow has been disabled in favor of local testing approach
# Run tests locally using: npm run local:accessibility, npm run local:performance
#
# To re-enable: uncomment the workflow below and remove this comment block
#
# Original workflow disabled on: July 23, 2025
# Reason: Moved to local-first development approach for faster feedback
#
# Local testing commands:
# - ./scripts/dev-check.sh (lint + build + quick test)
# - npm run local:accessibility (30s)
# - npm run local:performance (2min)
# - npm run local:smoke (30s)
# - npm run local:debug (visual debugging)

# This is a minimal valid workflow that does nothing (workflow is disabled)
