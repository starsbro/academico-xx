echo "🚀 Production Firebase Deployment with Message Ordering Fix"
echo "=========================================================="

echo ""
echo "🎯 Issue: Production Firebase has different timing characteristics than local"
echo "📊 Local: 300ms delay works for both fast/slow responses"
echo "🌐 Production: Needs 600ms delay for fast responses due to network latency"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Enhanced Production Fix Applied:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Local environment: 300ms delay (unchanged)"
echo "• Production Firebase: 600ms base delay"
echo "• Fast responses (<3s): Base delay"
echo "• Slow responses (>3s): Base delay + 200ms (max 1000ms)"
echo ""

echo "📋 Deployment Steps:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "1. 🏗️  Build and deploy frontend:"
echo "   cd frontend"
echo "   npm run build"
echo "   firebase deploy --only hosting"
echo ""
echo "2. 🔧 Deploy backend functions:"
echo "   cd ../backend"
echo "   firebase deploy --only functions"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Production Testing Protocol:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "After deployment, test on: https://academico-ai.web.app/academic-chat"
echo ""
echo "⚡ Test Fast Responses (should now work with 600ms delay):"
echo "• 'Hello'"
echo "• 'Tell me a simple joke'"
echo "• 'What is 2+2?'"
echo "• 'Hi there'"
echo ""
echo "🐌 Test Slow Responses (should work with 800ms delay):"
echo "• 'Write me a detailed story about space exploration'"
echo "• 'Explain quantum physics in detail'"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Production Console Logs to Monitor:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected for Fast Responses (~1656ms):"
echo "   [CHAT-COMPLETE] Full request completed in ~1656ms"
echo "   [CHAT-SYNC] PRODUCTION mode: Waiting 600ms for database sync"
echo "   [CLEAR-OPTIMISTIC] Removed 1 optimistic messages..."
echo "   [FETCH-MESSAGES] Message order: 1. User: \"Tell me...\", 2. AI: \"Why did...\""
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected for Slow Responses (~23028ms):"
echo "   [CHAT-COMPLETE] Full request completed in ~23028ms"
echo "   [CHAT-SYNC] PRODUCTION mode: Waiting 800ms for database sync"
echo "   [CLEAR-OPTIMISTIC] Removed 1 optimistic messages..."
echo "   [FETCH-MESSAGES] Message order: 1. User: \"Write me...\", 2. AI: \"The year...\""
echo ""

echo "📊 Environment Detection:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• localhost:3000 → LOCAL mode (300ms delay)"
echo "• academico-ai.web.app → PRODUCTION mode (600ms delay)"
echo "• Firebase Functions latency → Automatically handled"
echo ""

echo "💡 Why Production Needs Longer Delays:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Network latency between Firebase Functions and Firestore"
echo "• Cold start delays in serverless functions"
echo "• Distributed system consistency in multi-region setup"
echo "• CDN and edge caching effects"
echo ""

echo "🚨 If Still Issues After Deployment:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Increase baseDelay from 600ms to 800ms or 1000ms"
echo "• Check Firebase Functions logs for cold starts"
echo "• Verify Firestore region matches Functions region"
echo "• Test from different geographic locations"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Ready to Deploy Production Fix!"
echo ""
echo "Commands to run:"
echo "1. cd frontend && npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting"
echo "2. cd ../backend && firebase deploy --only functions"
echo "3. Test at: https://academico-ai.web.app/academic-chat"
