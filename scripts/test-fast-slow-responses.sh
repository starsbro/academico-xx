echo "🚀 Testing Fast vs Slow Response Message Ordering"
echo "================================================="

echo ""
echo "🎯 Issue Identified: Fast responses (940ms) showing wrong order"
echo "✅ Slow responses (20494ms) showing correct order"
echo ""
echo "🔧 Root Cause: Fast responses only got 100ms delay, not enough for DB sync"
echo "💡 Solution: Apply consistent 300ms delay for ALL responses"
echo ""

echo "📋 Comprehensive Test Protocol:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "1. 🌐 Open: http://localhost:3000/academic-chat"
echo "2. 🔐 Sign in if needed"
echo "3. 💬 Test BOTH fast and slow responses:"
echo ""

echo "   ⚡ FAST Response Tests (should be <2000ms):"
echo "   • 'Hello'"
echo "   • 'What is 2+2?'"
echo "   • 'Tell me a short joke'"
echo "   • 'Hi there'"
echo ""

echo "   🐌 SLOW Response Tests (should be >5000ms):"
echo "   • 'Write me a detailed story about space exploration'"
echo "   • 'Explain quantum physics in detail'"
echo "   • 'Create a comprehensive essay about climate change'"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Console Monitoring (F12 → Console):"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected Logs for FAST responses (~940ms):"
echo "   [CHAT-REQUEST] Starting chat request..."
echo "   [CHAT-RESPONSE] Received response after ~940ms"
echo "   [CHAT-COMPLETE] Full request completed in ~940ms"
echo "   [CHAT-SYNC] Waiting 300ms for database sync (response took 940ms)"
echo "   [CLEAR-OPTIMISTIC] Removed 1 optimistic messages..."
echo "   [FETCH-MESSAGES] Message order: 1. User: \"Tell me...\", 2. AI: \"Here's...\""

echo "✅ Expected Logs for SLOW responses (~20000ms):"
echo "   [CHAT-REQUEST] Starting chat request..."
echo "   [CHAT-RESPONSE] Received response after ~20000ms"
echo "   [CHAT-COMPLETE] Full request completed in ~20000ms"
echo "   [CHAT-SYNC] Waiting 300ms for database sync (response took 20000ms)"
echo "   [CLEAR-OPTIMISTIC] Removed 1 optimistic messages..."
echo "   [FETCH-MESSAGES] Message order: 1. User: \"Write...\", 2. AI: \"Here's...\""
echo ""

echo "🎯 Key Change: BOTH fast and slow responses now get same 300ms sync delay"
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected Results:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "✅ CORRECT Order (for BOTH fast and slow):"
echo "┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐"
echo "│ 👤 User: 'Tell me a short joke' (FAST)      │"
echo "├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤"
echo "│ 🤖 AI: 'Why did the chicken...' (940ms)     │"
echo "├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤"
echo "│ 👤 User: 'Write detailed story' (SLOW)      │"
echo "├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤"
echo "│ 🤖 AI: 'Here's a story...' (20494ms)        │"
echo "└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Step-by-Step Test:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "1. Send: 'Tell me a short joke' (FAST)"
echo "2. ✅ Verify: User message appears ABOVE AI response"
echo "3. Send: 'Write me a detailed story about space' (SLOW)"
echo "4. ✅ Verify: User message appears ABOVE AI response"
echo "5. Send: 'What is 2+2?' (FAST)"
echo "6. ✅ Verify: ALL messages maintain correct chronological order"
echo ""

echo "🚨 If Still Broken:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Check that [CHAT-SYNC] shows 300ms for ALL responses"
echo "• Verify [CLEAR-OPTIMISTIC] removes exactly 1 message"
echo "• Look for any JavaScript errors in console"
echo "• Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Test with BOTH Fast and Slow Messages!"
echo "Open: http://localhost:3000/academic-chat"
