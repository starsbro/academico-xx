echo ""
echo "🔍 Issue Identified: Backend Timestamp Race Condition"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "From the console logs, the problem was crystal clear:"
echo ""
echo "❌ WRONG ORDER (before fix):"
echo "1. AI: 'Why did the scarecrow...' - 1753303447754"
echo "2. User: 'Tell me a simple joke...' - 1753303447755  ← Only 1ms later!"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Root Cause: Backend using Promise.all() for message storage"
echo "• User message gets timestamp when Promise.all() executes"
echo "• AI message gets timestamp when Promise.all() executes"
echo "• AI message Promise can resolve first → gets earlier timestamp"
echo "• Result: AI messages stored before user messages!"
echo ""

echo "🛠️  Backend Fix Applied:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Generate timestamps BEFORE Promise.all()"
echo "• User message: current timestamp"
echo "• AI message: current timestamp + 1ms"
echo "• Guarantees user message always has earlier timestamp"
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected Result After Fix:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "✅ CORRECT ORDER (after fix):"
echo "1. User: 'Tell me a simple joke...' - 1753303447754"

echo "🚀 Deployment Steps:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "1. Deploy backend functions:"
echo "   cd backend"
echo "   firebase deploy --only functions"
echo ""
echo "2. Test on production:"
echo "   • Send a message like 'Hello'"
echo "   • Check console for raw timestamps"
echo "   • User timestamp should be BEFORE AI timestamp"
echo "   • Message ordering should be correct in UI"
echo ""

echo "🔍 What to Look For in Console:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected timestamp pattern:"
echo "[FETCH-MESSAGES] Raw message timestamps:"
echo "  7. User: 'Hello...' - 2025-07-23T21:05:01.998Z (1753304701998)"
echo "  8. AI: 'Hello! How can...' - 2025-07-23T21:05:01.999Z (1753304701999)"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected message order:"
echo "[FETCH-MESSAGES] Message order after sorting: ..., 7. User: 'Hello...', 8. AI: 'Hello! How can...'"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Testing Protocol:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "1. Deploy backend fix"
echo "2. Send test message: 'Test message ordering'"
echo "3. Check raw timestamps in console"
echo "4. Verify user timestamp < AI timestamp"
echo "5. Verify UI shows correct order"
echo ""

echo "💡 Why This Fix Works:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Eliminates race condition by pre-generating timestamps"
echo "• Guarantees chronological order regardless of Promise execution order"
echo "• Maintains parallel execution performance benefits"
echo "• Ensures consistent ordering across all message types"

echo "🎯 Deploy Backend Fix Now!"
echo "cd backend && firebase deploy --only functions"
