echo "🔍 Message Ordering Debug Analysis"
echo "=================================="

echo ""
echo "🎯 Issue Found: Sorting by timestamp is not working correctly"
echo ""
echo "From your logs, the messages are in wrong order even after sorting:"
echo "1. AI: 'Why did the scarecrow win an a...'"
echo "2. User: 'Tell me a simple joke...'"
echo "3. User: 'Tell me a simple joke again...'"
echo "4. AI: 'Okay, here's another simple on...'"
echo "5. AI: 'Hello! How can I help you toda...'"
echo "6. User: 'Hello...'"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Possible Root Causes:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Backend storing messages with incorrect timestamps"
echo "• Server and client timezone mismatches"
echo "• Race condition in database writes"
echo "• Firestore timestamp precision issues"
echo "• Message creation order not matching timestamp order"
echo ""

echo "🛠️  Enhanced Debug Added:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Raw timestamp logging before sorting"
echo "• Millisecond precision timestamp display"
echo "• User vs AI message identification"
echo "• Before/after sorting comparison"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Next Test Steps:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "1. Deploy the enhanced debug version"
echo "2. Send a test message on production"
echo "3. Check console for raw timestamps"
echo "4. Look for patterns in timestamp ordering"
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected Debug Output:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "[FETCH-MESSAGES] Raw message timestamps:"
echo "  1. User: \"Hello...\" - 2025-07-23T20:56:30.304Z (1721769390304)"
echo "  2. AI: \"Hello! How can...\" - 2025-07-23T20:56:32.125Z (1721769392125)"
echo "[FETCH-MESSAGES] Message order after sorting: 1. User: \"Hello...\", 2. AI: \"Hello! How can...\""
echo ""

echo "🚨 What to Look For:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Are user message timestamps BEFORE AI message timestamps?"
echo "• Are timestamps in correct chronological order?"
echo "• Any duplicate timestamps causing sorting issues?"
echo "• Server vs client timezone differences?"
echo ""

echo "💡 If timestamps are wrong in raw data:"
echo "• Backend issue with message storage timing"
echo "• Need to fix server-side timestamp generation"
echo ""
echo "💡 If timestamps are correct but sorting fails:"
echo "• Frontend sorting logic issue"
echo "• Need alternative sorting approach"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Deploy debug version and test!"
echo "cd frontend && npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting"
