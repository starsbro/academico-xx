echo "🔍 Enhanced Environment Detection Fix"
echo "===================================="

echo ""
echo "🚨 Issue Found: Environment detection was not working correctly"
echo "❌ Previous detection relied on process.env.NODE_ENV (unreliable in Next.js builds)"
echo "✅ New detection uses specific hostname patterns"
echo ""

echo "🛠️  Enhanced Detection Logic:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "• Firebase Hosting: *.web.app or *.firebaseapp.com → PRODUCTION"
echo "• Custom domain: academico-ai.* → PRODUCTION"
echo "• Non-localhost: Any domain except localhost/127.0.0.1 → PRODUCTION"
echo "• Localhost: localhost or 127.0.0.1 → LOCAL"
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected Console Logs After Fix:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "🌐 Production (academico-ai.web.app):"
echo "   [CHAT-SYNC] PRODUCTION mode (hostname: academico-ai.web.app): Waiting 600ms"
echo ""
echo "🏠 Local (localhost:3000):"
echo "   [CHAT-SYNC] LOCAL mode (hostname: localhost): Waiting 300ms"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Deployment Steps:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "1. Build and deploy frontend:"
echo "   cd frontend"
echo "   npm run build"
echo "   firebase deploy --only hosting"
echo ""
echo "2. Test on production URL and watch console logs"
echo "3. Look for: 'PRODUCTION mode (hostname: academico-ai.web.app): Waiting 600ms'"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Quick Test:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "After deployment, send a fast message like 'Hello' and check:"
echo "• Console should show hostname in the log"
echo "• Should see 'PRODUCTION mode' and '600ms' delay"
echo "• Message ordering should be correct"
echo ""

echo "💡 If still showing 300ms after deployment:"
echo "• Check the hostname in the console log"
echo "• Verify you're testing on the production URL"
echo "• Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5)"
